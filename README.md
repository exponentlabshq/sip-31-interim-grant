# SIP-31 Interim Grant: Design-Driven Development for Stacks

**By Exponent Labs LLC**

## The Problem

Stacks excels at backend smart contract development but lacks UI/UX focus. The ecosystem needs design excellence to drive adoption and maximize the value of its Bitcoin Layer-2 infrastructure.

> "You win or lose based on your user experience."

## The Solution

Rocky, the designer behind Zero Authority and BNS One, will **train and mentor a new generation of UI/UX designers** through hands-on experience design audits and redesigns of 8 top Stacks applications.

**The Critical Output**: A cohort of trained UI/UX experience designers who can continue elevating Stacks ecosystem design standards.

**Proven track record**: Rocky's designs for Zero Authority and BNS One correlated with measurable increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue.

**Design ROI**: Industry standard is 10x return on design investment.
