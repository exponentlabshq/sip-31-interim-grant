# SIP-31 Interim Grant: Design-Driven Development for Stacks

**By Exponent Labs LLC**

## The Problem

Stacks excels at backend smart contract development but lacks UI/UX focus. The ecosystem needs design excellence to drive adoption and maximize the value of its Bitcoin Layer-2 infrastructure.

> "You win or lose based on your user experience."

## The Solution

Rocky, the designer behind Zero Authority and BNS One, will conduct **experience design audits and UI/UX redesigns** for the top Stacks applications driving TVL, daily wallet activations, and transactions.

**Proven track record**: Rocky's designs for Zero Authority and BNS One correlated with measurable increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue.

**Design ROI**: Industry standard is 10x return on design investment.
