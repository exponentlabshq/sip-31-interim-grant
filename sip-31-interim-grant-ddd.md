## üôÇ Applicant Information                
- **Email:** contact@exponentlabs.llc
- **Twitter:** @exponentlabshq
- **Main project/association:** Exponent Labs LLC - Stacks ecosystem development and design
- **Notable ecosystem achievements or impact:**
  - Rocky designed the UI/UX for Zero Authority, resulting in measurable increases in transaction volume and new wallet creation
  - Rocky designed the UI/UX for BNS One (Bitcoin Name Service), contributing to platform success and user adoption
  - Demonstrated track record of 10x ROI on design investment across Stacks applications

## üìÉ Grant Overview
- **Grant Name:** Design-Driven Development (DDD) for Stacks
- **Total Budget (USD, STX, or BTC):** TBD based on scope
- **Grant Goal (in one sentence):** Train and mentor a new generation of UI/UX experience designers through hands-on design audits and redesigns of 8 top Stacks applications, building a sustainable talent pipeline for ecosystem growth.
- **Grant Audience:** Aspiring UI/UX designers, front-end developers seeking design skills, Stacks project teams, Bitcoin builders, and the broader Stacks community
- **Grant Team:** Rocky (@rocky_stacks), Blockface.btc (@blockface_btc), Exponent Labs LLC team

## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction
- **Grant Mission:** Empower aspiring UI/UX designers in the Stacks ecosystem to learn professional design practices through hands-on mentorship, real-world project audits, and collaborative creation of experience design prototypes. By training designers on 8 high-impact applications, we establish a sustainable talent pipeline that elevates design as a first-class discipline alongside smart contract development, ensuring the ecosystem has the human capital needed for long-term growth.

- **Grant Impact:** The critical output is a cohort of trained UI/UX designers equipped with real-world experience on 8 major Stacks applications (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar, StackingDAO, Hermetica, Boom Wallet, Faktory.fun, and Skullcoin). Each designer will work alongside Rocky in a mentorship model, learning to conduct audits, create prototypes, and deliver professional redesigns. The ecosystem gains both immediate improvements to applications through design audits and a long-term talent pool of designers who can continue elevating Stacks UX. This acts as a design-powered social layer that strengthens Stacks by attracting and retaining design-driven community members, positioning Stacks as the hub where design excellence and Bitcoin innovation meet.

- **Grant Risks:** 
  - **Risk:** Designer mentees may lack foundational skills. **Mitigation:** Screen candidates for basic design understanding, provide beginner-friendly guides, and offer 1-on-1 mentorship sessions tailored to skill level.
  - **Risk:** Low retention of trained designers post-grant. **Mitigation:** Build community through weekly livestreams, create ongoing opportunities through project partnerships, and establish a Stacks Design Guild for continued collaboration.
  - **Risk:** Quality dilution with multiple designers producing work. **Mitigation:** Rocky reviews all deliverables, provides feedback loops, and establishes quality criteria for audits and prototypes.
  - **Risk:** Timeline constraints with one project per week. **Mitigation:** Rocky has proven ability to deliver quality designs under deadline pressure, as demonstrated with Zero Authority and BNS One projects.

- **Traction:**
  - **Zero Authority:** Rocky's UI/UX design correlated with measurable increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue generation
  - **BNS One:** Design improvements led to strong user adoption and platform success
  - **Ecosystem demand:** Stacks currently lacks comprehensive UI/UX training and resources despite strong backend infrastructure
  - **Proven ROI:** Industry standard shows $10 return for every $1 invested in design
  - **Community recognition:** Rocky's work is recognized within the Stacks community as addressing "the final barrier to adoption"
