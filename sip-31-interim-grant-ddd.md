## üôÇ Applicant Information                
- **Email:** rocky@exponentlabs.ai
- **Twitter:** @rockyntheblock
- **Main project/association:** Exponent Labs LLC - Stacks ecosystem development and design
- **Notable ecosystem achievements or impact:**
  - Rocky lead the UI/UX Experience Redesign for Zero Authority, resulting in measurable increases in transaction volume and new wallet creation
  - Rocky lead the UI/UX Experience Redesign for BNS One (Bitcoin Name Service), contributing to platform success and user adoption

## üìÉ Grant Overview
- **Grant Name:** Design-Driven Development (DDD) for Stacks
- **Total Budget (USD, STX, or BTC):** TBD based on scope
- **Grant Goal (in one sentence):** Train and mentor a new generation of UI/UX experience designers through hands-on design audits and redesigns of 8 top Stacks applications, building a sustainable talent UI/UX Experience Design pipeline for ecosystem growth.
- **Grant Audience:** Aspiring UI/UX designers, front-end developers seeking design skills, Stacks project teams, Bitcoin builders, and the broader Stacks community
- **Grant Team:** Rocky (@rockyntheblock)

## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction
- **Grant Mission:** Empower aspiring UI/UX designers in the Stacks ecosystem to learn professional design practices through hands-on mentorship, real-world project audits, and collaborative creation of experience design prototypes. By training designers on 8 high-impact applications driving the path to $1B TVL in DeFi, we establish a sustainable talent pipeline that elevates design as a first-class discipline alongside smart contract development. As the leading Bitcoin L2 focuses on DeFi growth, user experience is table stakes‚Äîthis grant ensures the ecosystem has the human capital needed for long-term sustainability and builder success.

- **Grant Impact:** The critical output is a cohort of trained UI/UX designers equipped with real-world experience on 8 major Stacks applications (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar, StackingDAO, Hermetica, Boom Wallet, Faktory.fun, and Skullcoin). Each designer will work alongside Rocky in a mentorship model, learning to conduct audits, create prototypes, and deliver professional redesigns. As Stacks accelerates toward its $1B TVL milestone and positions itself as the fastest Bitcoin L2 with superior user experience and low-cost transactions, design excellence becomes critical infrastructure. The ecosystem gains both immediate improvements to applications through design audits and a long-term talent pool of designers who can continue elevating Stacks UX. This acts as a design-powered social layer that strengthens the leading Bitcoin L2 by attracting and retaining design-driven community members, ensuring builders have the resources needed as adoption scales. This positions Stacks as the premier destination where design excellence and Bitcoin innovation meet.

- **Grant Risks:** 
  - **Risk:** Designer mentees may lack foundational skills. **Mitigation:** Screen candidates for basic design understanding, provide beginner-friendly guides, and offer 1-on-1 mentorship sessions tailored to skill level. One of the interested participants is in school right now to become a UI/UX Designer.
  - **Risk:** Low retention of trained designers post-grant. **Mitigation:** Build community through weekly livestreams, create ongoing opportunities through project partnerships, and establish a Stacks Design Guild for continued collaboration.
  - **Risk:** Quality dilution with multiple designers producing work. **Mitigation:** Rocky reviews all deliverables, provides feedback loops, and establishes quality criteria for audits and prototypes.
  - **Risk:** Timeline constraints with one project per week. **Mitigation:** Rocky has proven ability to deliver quality designs under deadline pressure, as demonstrated with Zero Authority and BNS One projects.

- **Traction:**
  - **Zero Authority:** Rocky's UI/UX design correlated with measurable increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue generation
  - **BNS One:** Design improvements led to strong user adoption and platform success
  - **Ecosystem demand:** As Stacks focuses on DeFi growth and targets $250mm TVL by end of Q2 2025, the ecosystem lacks comprehensive UI/UX training despite strong backend infrastructure with Nakamoto, sBTC, and Clarity 4 upgrades
  - **Builder needs:** Stacks builders with listable tokens and growing protocols need professional design support to compete as the ecosystem scales and attracts millions of users
  - **Proven ROI:** Industry standard shows $100 return for every $1 invested in design‚Äîcritical for value accrual as adoption accelerates
  - **Alignment with roadmap:** This grant complements ongoing ecosystem growth initiatives including SIP-031 Interim Grant program, Stacks Ascent, and DeFi growth plans
  - **Community recognition:** Rocky's work is recognized within the Stacks community as addressing "the final barrier to adoption"

## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables

**Duration:** 8 weeks (under 2 months)
