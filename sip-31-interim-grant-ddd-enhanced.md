- **Grant Team:** Rocky (@rockyntheblock)

## üìä Impact Metrics & Cost Justification

**Primary Impact: Designer Training**
- **5-8 trained UI/UX designers** with professional portfolio work (8 real projects each)
- **Cost per designer trained:** $2,000-$3,200 per designer for 8 weeks of intensive mentorship
- **Value created per designer:** Each trained designer can deliver $50k-$100k+ annual value to ecosystem (based on industry design rates of $75-150/hour)
- **ROI timeframe:** Each designer generates 15-30x return within first year through project work

**Secondary Impact: Ecosystem Reach**
- **8 Stacks project teams** receive professional design audits and implementation guides
- **2,000+ community members** reached through 8 weekly livestreamed review sessions
- **500+ engaged viewers** attending live sessions and participating in Q&A
- **100+ developers** implementing design improvements based on audits
- **50+ builders** accessing reusable component library and design patterns

**Tertiary Impact: Long-term Ecosystem Growth**
- **Stacks Design Guild formation** creating sustainable talent pool for future projects
- **70%+ designer retention** ensuring trained designers remain active in ecosystem 6+ months
- **Self-sustaining mentorship** where trained designers mentor next cohort

**Cost Breakdown & Justification:**
- **Mentor compensation (Rocky):** $8,000 (50% of budget) - 40+ hours/week for 8 weeks including audit work, mentorship sessions, livestreams, and deliverable reviews
- **Mentee stipends:** $4,000 (25% of budget) - Small stipends for 5-8 mentees ($500-800 each) to enable participation
- **Tools & infrastructure:** $2,000 (12.5% of budget) - Figma licenses, design tools, hosting for component library
- **Community bounties:** $2,000 (12.5% of budget) - Implementation bounties for projects adopting designs

**Why designers are valuable:**
- Industry shows $100 return for every $1 invested in design
- Rocky's proven track record: Zero Authority and BNS One success demonstrate measurable business impact
- Design talent shortage is critical bottleneck for Stacks builders preparing for TGEs and listings
- Trained designers provide ongoing value across multiple projects (not single-use)

## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction

- **Grant Mission:** Empower 5-8 aspiring UI/UX designers in the Stacks ecosystem to learn professional design practices through hands-on mentorship, real-world project audits, and collaborative creation of experience design prototypes. By training designers on 8 high-impact applications driving the path to $1B TVL in DeFi, we establish a sustainable talent pipeline that elevates design as a first-class discipline alongside smart contract development. As the leading Bitcoin L2 focuses on DeFi growth, user experience is table stakes‚Äîthis grant ensures the ecosystem has the human capital needed for long-term sustainability and builder success.

- **Grant Impact:** The critical output is a cohort of 5-8 trained UI/UX designers equipped with real-world experience on 8 major Stacks applications (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar, StackingDAO, Hermetica, Boom Wallet, Faktory.fun, and Skullcoin). Each designer will work alongside Rocky in a mentorship model, learning to conduct audits, create prototypes, and deliver professional redesigns. Beyond the core cohort, the grant reaches 2,000+ community members through livestreamed sessions and provides professional design resources to 8 project teams. As Stacks accelerates toward its $1B TVL milestone and positions itself as the fastest Bitcoin L2 with superior user experience and low-cost transactions, design excellence becomes critical infrastructure. This acts as a design-powered social layer that strengthens the leading Bitcoin L2 by attracting and retaining design-driven community members, ensuring builders have the resources needed as adoption scales.

- **Grant Risks:** 
  - **Risk:** Designer mentees may lack foundational skills. **Mitigation:** Screen candidates for basic design understanding (portfolio review + skills assessment), provide beginner-friendly guides, and offer 1-on-1 mentorship sessions tailored to skill level. One interested participant is currently in school studying UI/UX Design.
  - **Risk:** Low retention of trained designers post-grant (target: 70%+). **Mitigation:** Build community through weekly livestreams, create ongoing paid opportunities through project partnerships, establish Stacks Design Guild with recurring projects, and track retention via 3-month and 6-month check-ins.
  - **Risk:** Quality dilution with multiple designers producing work. **Mitigation:** Rocky reviews all deliverables before publication, provides multiple feedback loops per project, establishes quality rubric for audits/prototypes, and maintains high bar demonstrated in Zero Authority and BNS One work.
  - **Risk:** Low community engagement in livestreams. **Mitigation:** Partner with project teams to promote sessions, offer bounties for participation, record and publish for async viewing, and leverage existing Stacks community channels for distribution.

- **Traction:**
  - **Zero Authority:** Rocky's UI/UX design correlated with measurable increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue generation
  - **BNS One:** Design improvements led to strong user adoption and platform success, demonstrating ROI on design investment
  - **Existing demand:** 3+ designers already interested in participating based on informal outreach
  - **Project interest:** Multiple projects (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar) already confirmed interest in receiving design audits
  - **Ecosystem demand:** As Stacks focuses on DeFi growth and targets $250mm TVL by end of Q2 2025, the ecosystem lacks comprehensive UI/UX training despite strong backend infrastructure with Nakamoto, sBTC, and Clarity 4 upgrades
  - **Builder needs:** Stacks builders with listable tokens and growing protocols need professional design support to compete as the ecosystem scales and attracts millions of users
  - **Proven ROI:** Industry standard shows $100 return for every $1 invested in design‚Äîcritical for value accrual as adoption accelerates
  - **Alignment with roadmap:** This grant complements ongoing ecosystem growth initiatives including SIP-031 Interim Grant program, Stacks Ascent, and DeFi growth plans
