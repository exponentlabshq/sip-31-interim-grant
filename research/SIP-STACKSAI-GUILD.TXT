üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction
Grant Mission:‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚ÄäTo empower AI enthusiasts in the Stacks ecosystem to learn advanced tools, collaboratively create AI-empowered content and codes, and earn rewards through community-driven bounties and Stacks projects partnerships.

Grant Impact:‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää

By equipping community members with AI skills, the Stacks AI Guild acts as an AI-powered social layer that enables builders to create engaging content such as professional videos, animations, short clips, polished graphics, memes, and tutorials that amplify marketing, boost awareness across social platforms, drive awareness and adoption of Stacks projects.

It also serves as a learning hub for AI developers, identify gaps in the ecosystem, build useful tools, rapidly prototype apps, shorten the path from MVP to GTM, and contribute to ecosystem enhancements.

By supporting community members' AI tools subscriptions, we would unlock their creativity to build and increase the rate of experimentations, output and productivity.

In effect, the Stacks AI Guild becomes a focused AI layer that strengthens Stacks by attracting and retaining AI-driven community members, increasing productive activity, and positioning Stacks as the hub where AI and Bitcoin innovation meet.

Grant Risks:

Low adoption if AI tools prove too complex for newcomers, mitigated by beginner-friendly guides and personal touches such as educational screen shares and 1:1 classes .
Market volatility affecting bounty rewards and member retention, addressed via diversified token funding sources.
Technical integration challenges between AI and Stacks, countered by community feedback loops and Stacks OG developers guidance.
Content quality dilution from rapid creation, managed through moderation and bounty criteria.
Dependency on platforms like X for traction, other social platform for community building like discord so we can always retain our community members and outreach.
Traction:
Currently

Active users: 60 members: 42 members of AI Visual Content enthusiasts + 21 members of AI Developer enthusiasts
Transaction volume: 150+ onchain transactions (increasing week by week) via ZeroAuthority + $130 USD value distributed back to AI content creators on Stacks
TVL: N/A currently, in the future we might look to have TVL
Waitlist: around 10~20 more people would like to enter the AI Guild, but we have not opened up fully yet for membership as we are currently in early "MVP" proof-of-concept phase. We will leverage our Intro Bootcamp event to get signups. Unable to tell how many will signup yet. Would estimate minimum 20 people would wanna signup to our Intro Bootcamp
